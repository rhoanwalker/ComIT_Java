1 - Take the example algorithm for Rocket.java. Fix the program so that it can handle speeds of up to ten million (10,000,000) meters per second.


2 - Create an application that reads in two names in all lowercase letters, and tells you which comes first alphabetically.


        Sample input/output:


        Please enter the first name: brenda
        Please enter the second name: bobby
        The name bobby is first.


3 - Run the application from question 2 again, but this time use a capital ‘B’ for brenda, and all lowercase for “bobby”:


        Please enter the first name: Brenda
        Please enter the second name: bobby


i)        What happens in this case?
ii)        Why does this happen?
iii)        How would you fix the problem?
